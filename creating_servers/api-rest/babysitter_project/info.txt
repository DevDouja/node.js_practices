** What  exactly is the Express Router? It is a mini express application without all the bells
and whistles of an express application, just the routing stuff. Let's take a look at exactly
what this means. We'll go through each section of our site and use different features 
of the Router.

** Using the Router, we are allowed to make our applications more modular and flexible than
ever before by creating multiple instances of the Router and applying them
accordingly

** Route middleware: in Express is a way to do something before a request is processed.
This could be things like checking if a user is authenticated, logging data for 
analytics, or anything else we'd like to do before we actually spit out
information to our user.
