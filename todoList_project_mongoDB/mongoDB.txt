What is MongoDB?
is a NoSQL database.

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead
of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use 
of collections and (JSON) documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic 
unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is 
the equivalent of relational database tables
